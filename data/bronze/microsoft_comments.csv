Nie wiem czy dobrze kieruje swoje pytanie  ale chciałbym zapytać Państwa o jedną rzecz :) Chodzi mi o dostępność konsoli poprzedniej generacji  czyli XBOX ONE S (model z 500 GB lub 1TB). Nie można jej obecnie dostać w oficjalnej sprzedaży chociaż nigdzie nie znalazłem informacji o zakończeniu przez Państwa jej produkcji  na wikipedii angielskojęzycz
nej wisi informacji  że cykl życia produktu jeszcze nie został zakończony. Wiem  że konsole były jeszcze dostępne jakoś w okolicach marca obecnego roku. Czy zakończyliście produkcję modelu XBOX ONE S już całkowicie i nie będzie można się spodziewać jego kolejnej partii na półkach sklepowych?

Dlaczego nie informujecie klientów  że płatność jest wykonywana przez zagranicznego operatora? W mojej opinii to zatajanie informacji  co skutkuje dodatkowymi opłatami dla klientów. Płacąc za subskrypcję nigdzie było informacji  że będę musiała ponieść taką opłatę.

I sent several e-mail to the Microsoft Office of Legal Compliance (OLC) but to responce.
My question is about the skype license conditions.
Is it acceptable from Microsoft legal policy perspective to apply Skype home application by judges for court trial purposes. For example if the states judge considers the case and guestion a suspect remotely via Skype home version installed on the judge's computer? Or the government body which support the states Court system should purchase Skype for business licenses under license agreement?

Microsoft,10158727738858721,"Microsoft as always is lagging behind the competition like Facebook or Google. Those two and other competitors have a big market lead not only in quality of their service but also in user (personal) data which have become a valuable commodity. In order to make up for a lag the Microsoft is employing a simple tactic: EXTORSION. They lock you out of your account and you have to pay to get back access to your services  information  contacts  in some cases your whole online existence. And the price is your personal information. In the least they try to trick you into our personal telephone number. Giving phone number to dubios companies like MS in very stupid indeed. But who knows where this stops? ID documents  pictures? in the end it can even be money. Pay us if ypu want to contact you family or something like that.

The solution sis more than simple. Just stop using MS services  accounts  everything.

I too am locked from my account for abbot two years now. The COVID pandemic  ensuing lockdown and resulting increased dependence on internet communication for social life and job is a perfect opportunity for MS to profit from that  And they are doing it without any shame at all.",2021-10-09 10:42:08,https://facebook.com/10158727738858721,Andrej Emeršič,,0,10158678471638721

Microsoft,10158353179163721,I am disappointed with the customer service handling and report that after 1.5 years my Surface Book is experiencing catastrophic system failure and won’t turn on. A 2k computer that had been used a handful of times and sits in a drawer shouldn’t stop working after such a short time. Customer service was supposed to connect me with a Manager and never reached out  my only option given by a customer service associate was to buy a brand new computer or a refurbished one. This is unacceptable to have to spend another thousand dollars after I spent 2k on the first computer. In addition  the customer service associate shamed me for not buying the extended warranty. Is it the customers fault for not predicting your software would fail within the first two years when the computer was barely used? I would like to request to connect with a high level representative to resolve this. I typically buy Apple products and took a chance on Microsoft  only to be scammed.,2021-04-09 15:13:41,https://facebook.com/10158353179163721,Stephanie Hendrixson,https://facebook.com/stephanie.hendrixson.1?fref=nf&rc=p&refid=52&__tn__=R,0,10158351928073721

Please ask a Tier 2 tech in the United States to call me right away at (message for the phone number or reference case# 1016223626). The initial problems was only with accessing Outlook 365 but the tech uninstalled all of the 365 apps and now I cannot access any files I urgently need - far worse off than I was when I first called 3 days ago.

Microsoft,10158169183793721,"Hello
I'm writing because I just learned that your company gave Josh Hawley $7500 in political donations over the last few years. I find this deeply distressing and disappointing.
Hawley did everything he could to overturn our election  and incited a violent insurrection that killed 5 people and could easily have killed many more. Despite his clear responsibility
he is completely unrepentant.
As if this isn’t bad enough  his party  as it is currently configured  supports white supremacy & hate  not to mention COVID denial  climate destruction  horrific income inequality  rampant voter suppression  and more.
Do Hawley’s actions reflect your corporate values? If so I will certainly avoid patronizing your business or owning your stocks in the future. And I’ll be sure to spread the word widely. I hope  however  that you will do the right thing and avoid ever giving to him or any GOP PAC that supports him again.
We will be watching.

Editor's note: This story contains graphic descriptions of an alleged sexual assault.
Updated at 12:56 p.m. ET
New information has emerged in recent days about a sexual assault allegation against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee  Joe Biden  made by Tara Reade  a former staff assistant in Biden's Senate office. For the first time  someone has gone on the record to say that Reade detailed the allegation to her decades ago in the same way Reade is describing it now.
The revelation  first reported by Business Insider  comes with increasing calls from Republicans for the accusation to be examined more openly and pressure on Democrats to respond. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  who endorsed Biden on Monday  expressed on Thursday that she has a ""great comfort-level with the situation.""
A former neighbor of Reade's named Lynda LaCasse told NPR on Wednesday about a conversation the two had approximately 25 years ago regarding the alleged assault.",2021-01-09 15:26:29,https://facebook.com/10158131970733721,Social Cause,https://facebook.com/Social-Cause-1633685860207488/?rc=p&__tn__=%7ER,0,10158131037018721

Microsoft,10158117375228721,"Microsoft Teams application in very poor design with limited options regarding accessibility features. Consequently that application doesn't cooperate well with the assistive technical software. For instance  due to my accessibility needs  I use 'Invert Brightness' option within ZoomText (provided by Sight and Sound Technology).

This required Microsoft applications (Outlook  Excel  Word  Powerpoint) to be placed in High Contrast White (for a total switch over to Black under ZoomText).

Unfortunately that option was not available on MS Teams application - thus frequent switch on / off on ZoomText causing distractions.

Is there something that can be done with regards to accessibility options for MS Teams to be more consistent with other MS applications please?",2021-01-09 15:44:19,https://facebook.com/10158117375228721,Des  Masterson,https://facebook.com/SmileyDes70?fref=nf&rc=p&refid=52&__tn__=R,0,10158055557748721
Microsoft,10158057279188721,DO NOT BUY THE MICROSOFT SURFACE. I AM NOW ON MY 3RD REPLACEMENT DEVICE  AND THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN RESOLVED. ALL THREE DEVICES EXPERIENCE SEVERE OVER HEATING AS WELL AS OTHER ISSUES. MY LAST STRAW WAS THAT I WAS GONE FOR A WEEK AND POWERED DOWN MY COMPUTER. WHEN I GOT BACK  THE COMPUTER WAS POWERED OFF  BUT STILL RIDICULOUSLY HOT. THIS HAS NOW TURNED INTO A SAFETY ISSUE. I WILL BE GETTING A REFUND AND TURNING TO A COMPANY WITH BETTER PRODUCTS THAT WONT RISK LIGHTING MY HOUSE ON FIRE.,2020-12-09 15:44:22,https://facebook.com/10158057279188721,Jason Bohrer,https://facebook.com/jason.bohrer.9?fref=nf&rc=p&refid=52&__tn__=R,0,10158055557748721
