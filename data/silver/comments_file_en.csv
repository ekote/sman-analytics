I've been on the phone with techs for the last few days - at least 8 hours on the phone and significantly more dealing with the problem in between. The case was escalated to Tier 2. They promised to call back this morning and haven't. Please ask a Tier 2 tech in the United States to call me right away at (message for the phone number or reference case# 1016223626). The initial problems was only with accessing Outlook 365 but the tech uninstalled all of the 365 apps and now I cannot access any files I urgently need - far worse off than I was when I first called 3 days ago. Again please have a Tier 2 tech from within the U.S. to call me ASAP.

HelloI'm writing because I just learned that your company gave Josh Hawley $7500 in political donations over the last few years. I find this deeply distressing and disappointing.Hawley did everything he could to overturn our election  and incited a violent insurrection that killed 5 people and could easily have killed many more. Despite his clear responsibilityhe is completely unrepentant.As if this isn‚Äôt bad enough  his party  as it is currently configured  supports white supremacy & hate  not to mention COVID denial  climate destruction  horrific income inequality  rampant voter suppression  and more.Do Hawley‚Äôs actions reflect your corporate values? If so I will certainly avoid patronizing your business or owning your stocks in the future. And I‚Äôll be sure to spread the word widely. I hope  however  that you will do the right thing and avoid ever giving to him or any GOP PAC that supports him again.We will be watching.Thanks,en,1.0,HelloI'm writing because I just learned that your company gave Josh Hawley $7500 in political donations over the last few years.

Yesterday  after all this work  I email what was to be the final review. Word mismashed the document. I clicked the 'saved by Microsoft' copy and spent hours redoing and it glitched several more times. By nightfall I got a message that my Word program was a one year license only and I was past the use date. (don't remember exact wording.

WARNING! DO NOT BUY A MICROSOFT SURFACE PRO!!!The battery in my computer is swelling and has destroyed the screen. This is a common problem with these machines and Microsoft knows it. There are countless forum posts and articles written about it. Yet Microsoft won't do anything about it.

Finally someone got back to me and said that my warranty has expired and my only option is to pay for a replacement! This is BS!An exploding battery is an extreme fire hazard. The CS rep even told me to unplug the device and not use it. This could potentially burn down my house! But they are unwilling to do anything about the defective and dangerous product they sold me.

I am disappointed with the customer service handling and report that after 1.5 years my Surface Book is experiencing catastrophic system failure and won‚Äôt turn on. A 2k computer that had been used a handful of times and sits in a drawer shouldn‚Äôt stop working after such a short time. Customer service was supposed to connect me with a Manager and never reached out  my only option given by a customer service associate was to buy a brand new computer or a refurbished one. This is unacceptable to have to spend another thousand dollars after I spent 2k on the first computer. In addition  the customer service associate shamed me for not buying the extended warranty. Is it the customers fault for not predicting your software would fail within the first two years when the computer was barely used?

My surface book 3 screen recently cracked after I just closed it. I did not drop it. It is now cracked. I noticed that there was a report that this could happen. I need it replaced and it is still under warranty. I could not figure out how to get in touch with customer service because when I tried to have them call me it never connected ( i was on hold for 45 minutes). I would like someone to contact me as this is very frustrating to buy a new computer for 2k+ and have it break despite having a protective glass and case that I use.

The money was stolen in almost 100 small purchases. I‚Äôve filed a police report. My bank has opened an investigation. I tried to request refunds on some of the charges and they were all denied.

Microsoft as always is lagging behind the competition like Facebook or Google. Those two and other competitors have a big market lead not only in quality of their service but also in user (personal) data which have become a valuable commodity. In order to make up for a lag the Microsoft is employing a simple tactic: EXTORSION. They lock you out of your account and you have to pay to get back access to your services  information  contacts  in some cases your whole online existence. And the price is your personal information. In the least they try to trick you into our personal telephone number. Giving phone number to dubios companies like MS in very stupid indeed. But who knows where this stops? ID documents  pictures? in the end it can even be money. Pay us if ypu want to contact you family or something like that.The solution sis more than simple. Just stop using MS services  accounts  everything.I too am locked from my account for abbot two years now. The COVID pandemic  ensuing lockdown and resulting increased dependence on internet communication for social life and job is a perfect opportunity for MS to profit from that  And they are doing it without any shame at all.,en,0.99,Microsoft as always is lagging behind the competition like Facebook or Google.

Only the control panel is clearer and more functional. I don't see any point in going to this system because it doesn't contribute anything.

I do not know if he directs his question well, but I would like to ask you about one thing :) I mean the availability of the previous generation console, i.e. XBOX ONE S (model with 500 GB or 1TB). It is currently impossible to get it in the official sale although nowhere I found information about the end of your production of it on the English wikipedia hangs information that the life cycle of the product has not yet been completed. I know that the consoles were still available somehow around March this year. Have you completely ended the production of the XBOX ONE S model completely and you will not be able to expect its next batch on store shelves? Best regards"

Why don't you inform customers that the payment is made by a foreign operator? In my opinion, this is a withholding of information, which results in additional fees for customers. When paying for the subscription, there was no information anywhere that I would have to pay such a fee. And I really do not mean the 12 z≈Ç but the fact that all Poles using a business account incur additional costs without even knowing it."
